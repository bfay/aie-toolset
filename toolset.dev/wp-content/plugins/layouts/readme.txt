A theme independant drag and drop layout generator for bootstrap themes.

== Description ==

The Layout plugin is intended to easily integrate drag and drop functionalities into your Bootstrap based theme. Layouts can be created with an advanced and complete layout editor.

The Layout plugin sits on a flexible and powerful API which lets you create your custom cell components, in a way very similar to the one you are familiar when you create post types and their meta boxes, and integrate them in the Layout editor and in your theme design.

As a theme author, a developer or an advanced Wordpress user you will be able to customise the layout and content you render with the plugin to the point that 80% of editing work, can be done with the Layout editor.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'wp-layout' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I make a generic page template editable by a drag and drop interface? =

You should create a php template in your theme and include a simple call to the the_ddlayout function and then assign the php template to a page.

= Is it possible to make a full theme editable with the Layout drag and drop interface? =

Of course: For more detailed informations and advanced usage read the Layout-Guides and the LayoutsThemeIntegration documents you can find in the plugin doc folder.
